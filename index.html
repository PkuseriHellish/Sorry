<p>Hello, this is piss man writing (my name is currently pkus now)</p>
<p>i dont really know what to write but uh yeah, sorry if my grammer is bad, this is my first time writing something like this</p>
<h3>Apology</h3>
<p>This is Pkus writing. Please allow me to apologize for my past actions from last year (2024).</p>
<p>It was around late February 2024, i saw a screenshot of Someone posting a cropped nsfw image of&nbsp;Bisque's OC on twitter, i somehow got in contact with him, i asked for CSEM (child sexual exploitation material) of Bisque's OC Ruby from Nuff/Zalgo, the person who made and posted the image. I was curious; I had no other intention but to make some "jokes" with the image. I wasn't sexually aroused or horny for the image. few days later, it was around 6-8 am February 25, i made a twitter account with a fake online indentity named qwertdumby, i posted nsfw art of Gui's Fursona and&nbsp;the nsfw bisque image by Zalgo. I was caught for being behind the account, i only made the account because i was extremely bored, i wasnt honestly thinking about the consequences and stuff, alot of my friends blocked me and i got banned from multiple servers, i shortly had a panic attack in my friend gc, stressed and sad. I think thats it.</p>
<p>Theres no word to describe how much i regreted doing what i had done, i wish i could travel back to time and stop myself. im very i mean very sorry for the people that i hurted intentionally or unintentionally. Im still a porn addict, im still trying to put an end to my addiction. I was hypersexual before but I was able to get it under control abit. Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Pkus.</p>
